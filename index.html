<h1> Burritos</h1>
<body>Burritos have an extensive history behind them going deep into the past. Juan Méndez, a street vendor in Chihuahua, Mexico, invented the burrito. During the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s, Méndez decided to wrap his food in flour tortillas to keep it warm and transport it on his small donkey. He then realized that wrapping the food in a tortilla was tasty and a good way to serve it.Tortilla is a round, thin, flat bread of Mexico made from unleavened cornmeal or, less commonly, wheat flour. In Mexico, meat and refried beans are frequently the only fillings.<h3>Common Ingredients</h3><li>Cheese</li> <li>Beans</li> <li>Onion</li> <li>Chili Pepper</li> <li>Flour or Corn Tortilla</li> </body>
